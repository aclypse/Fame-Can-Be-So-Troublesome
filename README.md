 # FameCanBeSoTroublesome
This game is a copy of Honkai Impact 3rd mini-game from June's event called "Straying Stars". I've created it to develop and train my coding abilities, which I'm still in the process of developing.
Essentially, I wanted to create this game in a span of a week or two, because I believed that an endless runner would be a very simple and quick project. **boi was i wrong.** i've worked on this project for around 2 or 3 months.

## Installation instructions
Open the Game folder and extract the .exe file

## Description of the project
Despite all the challenges I've encountered, I really enjoyed working on it. i think i went through all the stages of a typical new indie game developer: excitedness, confidence, troubleshooting, disappointment, depression... you name it.
But no matter what difficulties appeared on my path, thanks to the tutorials i found and of course, the awesome Unity Discord community (which I will mention many times here), i've managed to code this game and finally publish it.
I'm proud to say that i've created this game from scratch. all the assets (despite the few mentioned below) i created myself. the music i created myself. and i found a way to write the code myself. (thank God for online tutorials of course)
I can say with utmost confidence that i enjoyed the process and stages of creating a game. And this definitely isn't the last project you will see from me.
